# VOLUME_CURVES contains the volume configuration for each track. For each pair of values, the first one represents the speed (percentage), while the second one represents the volume (from 0 to 1).
# For example, if the maximum speed is set to 50 km/h, and we have (30, 0.5), it means that when 30 % of 50 km/h (= 15 km/h) is reached, the volume of the associated track will reach 50 %.
# Feel free to add, remove and modify the values and value pairs for each track, but you MUST keep them in ascending order (according to the speed percentage).
# You also need to specify at least the 0 % and 100 % pairs.
