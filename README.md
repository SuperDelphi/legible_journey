Legible_journey art project

## legible.py

The project's main program controls interactive sound based on bicycle movement. It has two modes:

### Long Trip Mode (Default)
- Three sounds (s5, s6, s7) that respond to speed ranges:
  - 0-7 km/h: "bliss" sound plays
  - 7-16 km/h: "story" sound plays
  - Above 16 km/h: "deconstruction" sound plays
- Sounds fade smoothly between transitions
- If wheel stops for 30 seconds:
  - All sounds stop
  - Sequence resets
  - Will start fresh when movement resumes

### Short Trip Mode
- Sequential playback of sounds over time frames:
  1. 0-30s: Gradual introduction of s1, s2, s3
  2. 30s-2m30s: Speed-controlled s4
  3. 2m30s-4m30s: Variable s5
- Resets after completion

## Configuration
- Speed thresholds adjustable in legible.py:
  - SLOW_MAX = 7 km/h
  - MEDIUM_MAX = 16 km/h
- Sound transition rate: FADE_RATE = 0.5
- Measurement period: PERIOD = 3.5 seconds

## legible.py

The project's main program. According to the speed of a bike's wheel, the program will adjust independently the volumes of 3 custom audio tracks. Its behaviour can be configured inside `config.py`. The program now includes master volume control via a rotary encoder and visual feedback through an RGB LED.

## wheel_meter.py

This program reads sensor signals to measure:
1. The rotation speed of the main wheel using a Hall sensor
2. The movement of the pedal using another Hall sensor
3. Tracks milestones based on active riding time

It is a dependency of `legible.py`.

### How it works

1. The main wheel sensor measures rotation speed for audio track mixing
2. The pedal sensor detects when the bike is being actively pedaled
3. When both wheels are moving, the system:
   - Tracks active riding time
   - Counts milestones (every 1 minute by default)
   - Triggers milestone marks every 3 milestones
4. Visual feedback is provided through an RGB LED:
   - Green brightness increases with milestones
   - Blue blinks when audio track volumes change significantly

## hardware_controls.py

Manages additional hardware components:

### RGB LED
- Shows milestone progress through green brightness levels
- Blinks blue when audio changes occur
- Uses GPIO pins 5 (red), 6 (green), and 13 (blue)

### Volume Encoder
- Controls master volume using a rotary encoder
- Includes save functionality to persist volume settings
- Uses GPIO pins:
  - 23 (CLK)
  - 24 (DT)
  - 25 (SW)
  - 16 (Save button)

> Note: The wiring diagram needs to be updated to include the new components (RGB LED, rotary encoder, and save button)

## Usage

1. Connect all hardware components
2. Configure settings in `config.py` if needed
3. Run `legible.py`
4. Use the rotary encoder to adjust master volume
5. Monitor speed and sound transitions in debug mode

## Debug Mode
The legible.py program starts on boot. To run manually:
1. Stop existing processes:
   ```bash
   ps aux | grep python
   kill -9 [process_ID]
   ```
2. Enable debug output in config.py:
   ```python
   DEBUG_MODE = True
   DEBUG_SOUND = True  # For sound transitions
   DEBUG_MAIN_WHEEL = True  # For speed readings
   ```

3. Audio configuration

   to see the list of audio devices
   ```bash
   aplay -l
   ```

   edit the audio configuration file
   ```bash
   sudo nano /etc/asound.conf
   ```
